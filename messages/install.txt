DokuWiki Syntax v1.1.0 installed!

Currently this package provides syntax highlighting for DokuWiki syntax, and lists the heading structure of a DokuWiki file in the Goto Anywhere symbol list (Ctrl-R, or ⌘R on Mac). Snippets coming soon.

If you aren’t seeing syntax highlighting, chances are you’re using a color scheme that doesn’t include syntax highlighting for markup. Try another color scheme and you might have better luck.

Files with a .docuwiki extension are automatically opened in DokuWiki syntax mode. Otherwise, you can select DokuWiki syntax manually (from the Command Palette, from the syntax list at the bottom-right of the Sublime Text 2 window, or from the View > Syntax menu).
