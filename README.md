# Installation

The easiest way to install this package is using [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). Alternatively, you can clone this repository or download and extract its files into a subfolder of your Sublime Text 2 Packages folder.

# Status

A relatively complete package of functionality, ready for production use. Still room for some tweaks and additional convenience features to be added, though!
