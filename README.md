This is a port and refresh of the [DokuWiki bundle for TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/dokuwiki.tmbundle) for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

# Features

  * DokuWiki syntax definition (i.e. code highlighting)
  * List headings in Goto Anywhere symbol list

## Planned

  * DokuWiki syntax snippets

# Installation

The easiest way to install this package is using [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). Alternatively, you can clone this repository or download and extract its files into a subfolder of your Sublime Text 2 Packages folder.

# Status

Currently under development. What’s here is useful, but it isn’t yet complete. It should be safe to use, however. Feel free to install it, and update your copy as it develops!
